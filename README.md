## About this project
Over the past 40 decades, the music market has undergone a significant transformation. Gone are the days when physical formats like CDs and cassettes dominated. The introduction of the iTunes Music Store in 2003 marked a pivotal moment, as the industry shifted towards digital downloads, which also had a profound impact on US Music Revenues. 

<br>

**Objective:**
In this project, I have played the role of a Data Visualization Specialist at Maven Music. My task was to create a single visual chart to illustrate how the composition of the music market has changed over the last 40 years for physical and digital formats using Google Sheets. <br>
The chart should be easy enough to understand by itself, by maximizing the use of a descriptive title.<br>
The chart will be presented to the magazineâ€™s Chief Editor.

**Data Source:** The data is derived from the *RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) dataset*, which includes US music revenues by format, from 1973 to 2019.


## Approach
To effectively compare the music revenues (physical vs. digital), I used a combo area chart. This helps to grasp the composition of the music market in the fastest way. 

With labelling the maximum revenues, the areas to the corresponding formats and the launching year of iTunes Store, as well as with sticking to a consistent palette of color thourought the design, this helped me to not use the legends and to keep the visual minimal and descriptive.
