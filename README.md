## About this project
Over the past 40 decades, the music market has undergone a significant transformation. Gone are the days when physical formats like CDs and cassettes dominated. The introduction of the iTunes Music Store in 2003 marked a pivotal moment, as the industry shifted towards digital downloads, which also had a profound impact on US Music Revenues. 

**Objective:** <br>
In this project, I played the role of a Data Visualization Specialist at Maven Music. My task was to create a single visual chart to illustrate how the composition of the music market has changed over the last 40 years for physical and digital formats using Google Sheets. <br>
The chart should be easy to understand on its own, maximizing the use of a descriptive title.<br>
The chart will be presented to the magazineâ€™s Chief Editor.


**Data Source:** <br> 
The data is derived from the *RIAA (Recording Industry Association of America) dataset*, which includes US music revenues by format, from 1973 to 2019.


## Approach
To effectively compare the music revenues (physical vs. digital), I used a combo area chart. This helps visually grasp the composition of the music market.

By labeling the maximum revenues of each format, the areas corresponding to the formats, and the launching year of the iTunes Store, as well as sticking to a consistent color palette throughout the design, the chart does not require extra space for the legend. The visuals become lighter and easier on the eyes.


## Insights
Physical formats brought a total revenue much greater than the Digital format revenues over the past 40 decades, with the highest peak revenue of the Physical formats around $22.3B.

Digital formats took the lead in the music industry ever since the launch of the iTunes Music Store in 2003, but the revenues are not even half of what they were at their peak ($11.1B).
