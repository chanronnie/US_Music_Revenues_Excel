## About this project
Over the past 40 decades, the music market has undergone a significant transformation. Gone are the days when physical formats like CDs and cassettes dominated. The introduction of the iTunes Music Store in 2003 marked a pivotal moment, as the industry shifted towards digital downloads, which also had a profound impact on US Music Revenues. 

#### Objective of the project
In this project, I have played the role of a Data Visualization Specialist at Maven Music. My task was to create a single visual chart to illustrate how the composition of the music market has changed over the last 40 years for physical and digital formats using Google Sheets. The chart will be presented to the magazineâ€™s Chief Editor.
