## About
Over the past 40 decades, the music market has undergone a significant transformation. Gone are the days when physical formats like CDs and cassettes dominated. The introduction of the iTunes Music Store in 2003 marked a pivotal moment, as the industry shifted towards digital downloads, which also had a profound impact on US Music Revenues. 

In this project, I will create a visual chart to illustrate the evolution of the music market using Google Sheets. <br>
The data I will use is from **RIAA data (from 1973 to 2019)**.
